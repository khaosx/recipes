* 1 lb smoked pulled chicken thighs
* 28 oz crushed tomatoes
* 12 oz frozen whole kernel corn
* 10 oz frozen cream corn, thawed

### Directions
Chop onion and mince garlic. Add 1 tbsp of oil to a stock pot or dutch oven and heat over medium heat. Saut√© garlic and onions for 3 minutes, or until tender and aromatic.

Add chicken stock, and all remaining ingredients (except for the meat and lemon juice). Stir well to combine, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer on low for three and a half hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. 

Stir in pulled pork, pulled chicken, and lemon juice. Cover and cook for an additional 30 minutes. Serve with hot sauce and saltines.
